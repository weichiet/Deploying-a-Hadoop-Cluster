# On-demand Hadoop clusters
In this lesson, Amazonâ€™s Elastic MapReduce (EMR) was used to deploy an on-demand Hadoop cluster. This cluster is used to analyze a Web server log file.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this lesson is same as the one used in another Udacity's course, [Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617). Detail of the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/weichiet/Intro-to-Hadoop-and-MapReduce/tree/master/web_server_log).

## Problem Set
1. [Most hits](./most-hits)
2. [Average hits](./avg-hits)

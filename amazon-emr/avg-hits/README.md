Q: Write a mapper and reducer that calculates the average hits for each day of the week. What is the average number of hits on Saturday?  

A: Output MapReduce program:

| Day  | Number of Hits|
|  :---:  |  :---:   |
| 0   | 5404.3826087 |
| 1   | 5537.69298246 |
| 2   | 6642.03389831 |
| 3   | 5849.38461538 |
| 4   | 5140.18421053 |
|  5  | 3814.06730769|
|  6  | 3938.85185185|

So on Saturday (day 5), there are roughly 3814 hits on average.
